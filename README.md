# Kathir's(KD) Logbook

The idea behind the website was to have a way for me to keep logs of everything I have done. 
The primary use case is for me to keep tracks of comics that I have read. 
It should prove very useful for keeping track of the amount of chapters I have read, what my thoughts on it were and other similar features.
It can grow in the future to other things I could keep a log of, like restaurants I liked or movies I enjoyed.

# Hand-in 1 .v1 -

Created a home page  with different options for the different categories
Created the "Comics" page and made it show some of the comics I have read. Expandable with more comics that I read
Created the "Solo Leveling" page and made it show the basic info about the comic. Will expand the page's features in the future
Made all three pages responsive for mobiles, tablets and laptops

# Kathir's(KD) Logbook  

The idea behind the website was to have a way for me to keep logs of everything I have done.  
The primary use case is for me to keep tracks of comics that I have read.  
It should prove very useful for keeping track of the amount of chapters I have read, what my thoughts on it were and other similar features.  
It can grow in the future to other things I could keep a log of, like restaurants I liked or movies I enjoyed.  

## Hand-in 1 .v1 -  

- Created a home page  with different options for the different categories.  
- Created the "Comics" page and made it show some of the comics I have read. Expandable as I read more comics.  
- Created the "Solo Leveling" page and made it show the basic info about the comic. Will expand the page's features in the future.  
- Made all three pages responsive for mobiles, tablets and laptops.  

# âœ… Hand-in Requirements:
Hand-in your project as git repository, including a README.md file. The repository should contain at least 3 HTML pages which are linked to each other. They must be styled using a variety of CSS rules (without framework). All pages should be responsive, using media queries and at least 2 breakpoints.
